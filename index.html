        <h1>Modelling Heart Disease Project</h1>
        <p>
            We chose to create the IT tools to help research a cure for heart disease.<br>

            We want to help research a cure for heart disease, specifically for plaque, a  fatty, waxy substance that can build up in artery walls. Atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. It is the number one killer in developed countries. 
            
            We are providing models, with animation of the heart and vessels with plaque and without. We then imported these models into Unity and created a simulation system to allow experiments on how plaque restricts blood flow, and how to restore the blood flow.
            
            <br>Our system will continue to improve and allow research experiments.

            There's a <a href="Simulation.html">simulation</a> up now but its just a starting point, there will be more coming soon.
            If you want to see our code or our project <a href="https://github.com/plaque-heart">Click Here!</a>
            You can join our project on Gihub,  download and set experiment settings in the 'right' object.  Settings for sample size and timing are there already but you can add others.
            If you join as a full member you can use all the tools and help improve our tools and fluid dynamics to make better and better ways to research heart disease.
